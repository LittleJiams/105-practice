      <h2>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h2>
      <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>Get up take a walk, get some fresh air, get something to eat or drink, do whatever you can to get frustration out then get back to it with a fresh mind.</p>
